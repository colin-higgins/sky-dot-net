# sky-dot-net
Service discovery framework for the .NET community

## Static Registry
Use it as a static registry to remove your **n x n** problem of **services x configuration** transforms.

## Dynamic Registry
Use it as a key based lookup for your service locations. 
Services register themselves and heartbeats let you know when a service is down.

## High availability registry
Register your services with priority and time to wait.
